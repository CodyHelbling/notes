What is deep learning?
    - A subfield of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the 
    structure and function of the brain's neural networks.
    
What are the models in deep learning called?
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    
What is an Artifical Neural Network?
    - Computing systems that are inspired by the brain's neural networks.
    - These networks are based on a collectoin of connected units called 
    artifical neurons, or neurons.
    - Each connection between neurons can transmit a signal from one neuron 
    to another.
    - The receiving neuron processes the signal and signals downstream 
    neurons connected to it.
    - Neurons are organized into layers: 
        - Input layer
        - Hidden layers
        - Output layer
    - Neurons can be though of as nodes, connected by edges
